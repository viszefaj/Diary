9:00 i come to office i started searching for creating session part using local storage
I create session but i had a problem with saving data in session.. Every time i store data, the storage keep only the last datas of values..
So i brainstorming for solutions.
I tried in many ways but it shows same problem. So i ask Enea and i explain the situation.
He tell me to work with props and get/set item in local storage.
I was trying all day, but i get same thing..
So i decide to search other solutions to save data in session..
