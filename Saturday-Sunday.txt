Saturday ------------------------------------------------
I had a online call with Frajdi and Bjorni and we discussed about post data part.
We didnt know where to save the data, so we started brainstorming ..
I was thinkingof creating a new table for data , where has columns , user_id and data in json and to store all data in same column.
